It's not the same as the current API but it might suit your needs as a short term fix. The blobstore itself (and it's upload handlers) are not being deprecated currently and are covered by the deprecation policy so you know they will be sticking around for a while even if Google decides to deprecate them.

But if i make same changes in GetData and run from GetData notebook it is reflected.

Natael, Some questions and comments to understand the problem better. 1- Since you are concerned about the new data being overwritten by the old backed up data, it seems that you want to 'add' the backed up data to the new data (without any modifications to the new data). 2- Based on the way the data (records) is created by your app, you may need to take care of any conflicts between the primary key values of the newer records and the older records when 'adding' old records to the current database. Just pointing out; this may not be an issue in your case. 3- How many tables are involved?"

In addition, I have run into databases (many moons ago) that would throw compiler errors when the EXISTS clause contained a GROUP BY and you used SELECT *. Myself, I use SELECT 1 because I've never run into a DB that didn't handle it correctly and it allows me to search and destroy uses of SELECT * in code."

Don't try to ask a new question in an edit to the old one - it just makes everything confusing for readers who find this question (e.g. from google)"
31507931,31526805,51000437,"When the user changes the username, does the old username still exist in the database?"
31507931,31526805,51007711,"@Rob Winch yeap it does not exist anymore. I use an update query which look like.. `UPDATE table_name SET username = newusername WHERE username = oldusername` (yes I use prepared statements, I wrote it like that here just to be easier to understand). Just to be sure I run a select query through workbench just to be sure..
As I said its not a DB problem..if I stop the web app and restart it then the old username does not validate which is good..so somehow (maybe there is something missing) Security still remembers that this username is still validated..I do not use cached connection with JDBC.."
31507931,31526805,51009259,"Oh dear god how silly I feel now..1)what do you mean incognito window?Uknown window?You mean if the ""old user"" can access a page that needs authentication?2)What I can really say is that it uses the **Dao for login** because I have a system out with the query and it does show it on the 1st login and on the 2nd,3rd login (new username, old username corespondigly). 3) Debug logs..err I 'll just have to read on how to do that :$ Can you please confirm that if after the update has been done the code in my question should do the trick?Is that code in the end enough for ""forgetting"" the ""old"" user?"
31507931,31526805,51011458,"@Robin Winch Sir I think I found something intresting..During the Dao for login returns a `Map<String, userdetails> repository` . After username change has happened, user is redirected to logout page. (I confirmed through Workbench + Jdbc query that old username does not exist anymore) now that method of dao does not enter the if condition (as expected) `if (resultset != null && resultset.next())` and goes to the else which has nothing..so it returns an empty repository. As now I see inside **userdetails service** it should throw `UsernameNotFoundException` but it does not!! Continue below.."
31507931,31526805,51011563,"**userdetails service** contains the loadbyusername method which contains the following..`userdetails user = (daoname.login(username)).get(username);
  if(user == null){
   throw new UsernameNotFoundException(""User not found.."");
  }
  return user;`
Shouldn't I see that exception when I login with the old username that does not exist?"
31507931,31526805,51013351,Ok I found the black hole :P although after username change has happened and the user is redirected to the login page..assume he tries to login with the old one..then the dao for login is called as it should BUT userdetails service does NOT throw sernameNotFoundException as it should..the question is why? **Dao enters the empty else** (because resultset is null). Now how on earth does userdetails user = (daoname.login(username)).get(username); does not equal null?
31507931,31526805,51014354,"Ok finally bug confirmed to be the fact that after every login the repository returned from the dao is appended, so after 5 different users login it contains 5 different keys. If a user changes his username then the old one will exist on this repository.So I think of 5 possible solutions..1) after every login before accessing the DB that HashMap should be empty first (delete all content). 2) Delete with a method the old value. Question: multiple users are supposed to use the app..Do they share the same instance of dao?I mean if before login the HashMap gets empty does other users have problem?"
